# Cities Skyline II McDonalds Decals
## by Kaidius 
McDonalds Signal Pack for Cities Skyline II
In the long term, I would like to create and publish a McDonalds asset for Cities Skyline II.
This is the first time I've tried modding. I only have experience in web design and media design. I still hope you'll like this project. Your Kaidius
